## Elucidate Olfactory Map Formation Mechanism with Molecular Basis
The sense of smell serves variety of important functions in everyday life. The olfactory features are likely carried out by distinct functional networks of topographic map of ORs which are reffered as '**zone**'. The zonal organization in OE is initially formed in early developmental stages but reorganized during postnatal state also. With **spatiotemporal profiling** of spatial & single cell level gene expression information, we urge to investigate **molecular basis of olfactory map formation mechanism** in OE.

## CDS biomarker study - Diagnostic study in veterinary neurodegenerative diseases

Cognitive dysfunction syndrome(CDS, also known as canine cognitive disorder) is a condition that occurs in elderly dogs and shows clinically similar patterns to human neurodegenerative disorders. However, there is currently no objective or precise diagnostic method for CDS, and much more needs to be learned about the condition.
Our goal is to discover biomarkers that enable objective diagnosis of CDS. Based on the hypothesis that CDS shares similar features with human neurodegenerative diseases, and taking the pathological correlation between brain and nose into consideration, **we aim to utilize proteomics to discover and validate biomarkers in nasal discharge of dogs**.
